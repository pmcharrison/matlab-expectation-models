These are a collection of wrappers for two tonal expectation models as implemented in MATLAB:

- Leman's Periodicity-Pitch model
- Collins et al.'s Tonal Expectation model

The code is currently quite disorganised and it would be good to neaten it up.
Note that the code relies on the IPEM toolbox and the Janata Lab Music Toolbox (JLMT),
which must be installed separately.
